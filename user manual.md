Introduction
Parallel inversion software of gravity gradiometry data (PIS-G) is used for obtaining underground density distribution accurately, suitable for the large-scale data inversion research and education. PIS-G is developed by Python, combined with OpenMP and CUDA. At present, it offers the functions of data & file management, visualization, forwarding and inversion; in the future work, more powerful functions would be introduced into this platform by secondary development. It is demonstrated to be practical and easy-to-use in the tests. We hope it could be helpful for your study and work!

Configuration requirement: CPU: dual core processor 2.5GHz; Memory: 4GB RAM; GPU: NVDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti; System: Windows XP or 7 or 10.
Program size: 178 MB

It is noted that the user’s computer must be equipped with GPU supporting CUDA, or the inversion module would not work.
